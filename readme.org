#+OPTIONS: H:2

* Important Notice
This is a fork of SFML that was used to test binding C++ libraries from clasp. It is still here for archival purpopses, but is not of any real use.

If you are looking for the clasp binding for SFML, go to https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp-sfml.

If you are looking for the SFML library, go to http://www.sfml-dev.org/.

And now for the rest of the original readme:

* What is this?
This fork of SFML contains some early test bindings for accessing SFML from clasp

* How do I compile?
- Get the following dependency libraries as dev version via your package manger
  - pthread
  - opengl
  - xlib
  - xrandr
  - udev
  - freetype
  - glew
  - jpeg
  - sndfile
  - openal
- Run cmake-gui, enter the src and build directories, hit configure and select "specify native compilers" and select the clang compiler from clasp-externals.
- You will get an error message about two missing directories. Specifiy the CLASP_INCLUDE_PATH and EXTERNALS_CLASP_PATH manually. 
- Hit configure again, then generate.
- call "make" in the sfml build directory that you specified.

* What do I do with it?
- The first goal is to recreate the example from http://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.2/ in common lisp
- A small lisp test program can be found at https://github.com/HeyFlash/clasp-stuff/blob/master/sfml-test.lsp

* Todo
** SoundRecorder: There should be a to_object converter for std::vector<std::string> (is there?)
** SoundBuffer: Missing Assignment operator
** SoundSource: Missing to_object and from_object converters for const Vector3f&
** SoundStream: Currently not handling struct Chunk: converters?
** Sound : Missing assignment operator

* Questions
** SoundSource: How to handle copy constructors?
** What to do with static functions
** What to do with classes that have protected constructors, that are meant to be called by derived classes?
